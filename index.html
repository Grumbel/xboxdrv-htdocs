      <p>
        Long story short, the xpad kernel driver that comes with the
        Linux kernel doesn't work with the XBox360 gamepad and the newer
        ones found in the xbox-linux CVS trees, works in theory, but
        currently just crashes for me. So I wrote my own one and due to lack
        of Linux kernel knowledge one that works with libusb in
        userspace. As a nice side effect this makes it much easier to
        configure the gamepad for games with special requirements.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>runs in userspace on top of libusb, no kernel recompile
          required, very easy to get started</li>
        <li>gives you what you would expect from a driver, like a
          normal joystick device and a event device</li>
        <li>allows you to handle analog-triggers as a single z-axis, as buttons or as
          seperate axis</li>
        <li>allows you to handle the dpad as buttons or as axis</li>
        <li>allows you to set the LED status of the XBox360 gamepad</li>
        <li>allows you to set the rumble motors, for use in scripts for
          new mail notification</li>
        <li>it supports the use multiple gamepads</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Missing Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>rumble support is limited to scripting or testing, it
          doesn't yet support Linux force feedback handling, so you
          can't use it in games</li>
        <li>you can't remap the buttons</li>
        <li>you can't change the order of axis</li>
        <li>XBox dancemat support is untested and limited</li>
        <li>XBox360 wireless gamepad support not working</li>
        <li>XBox's analog face buttons can't be used via the joystick
          device, since they are converted to digital ones</li>
        <li>no mouse emulation</li>
        <li>no chatpad support</li>
        <li>no way to configure deadzone</li>
        <li>no headset support (is that even possible from userspace?)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to help</h2>
      <p>
        I only have a wired USB XBox360 gamepad, as well as two XBox
        Classic gamepads. So I need people to test support for XBox360
        wireless gamepads as well as the support for the dancemat. The
        dancemat itself should already work with just a few to many
        buttons and axis being displayed. With the wireless XBox360
        gamepad on the other side there are still some things I don't
        know about the protocol, i.e. how are multiple controllers
        handled or how to switch the LED on the pads that might
        require some experimentation. And another thing is the
        chatpad, I would like to at support for that to, but so far I
        could find no documentation on it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you have some spare time and either a dancemat, multiple
        wireless XBox360 controller + USB adapter or a Chatpad and
        would like to help, drop me a mail
        to <a href="mailto:grumbel@gmx.de">grumbel@gmx.de</a> or
        contact me via ICQ:59461927 or Jabber
        xmpp:grumbel@jabber.org.
