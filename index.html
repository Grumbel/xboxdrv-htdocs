      <h1>Userspace XBox/XBox360 USB Gamepad Driver for Linux</h1>
      <p>
        Long story short, the xpad kernel driver that comes with the
        Linux kernel doesn't work with the XBox360 gamepad and the newer
        ones found in the xbox-linux CVS trees, works in theory, but
        currently just crashes for me. So I wrote my one and due to lack
        of Linux kernel knowledge one that works with libusb in
        userspace. As a nice side effect this makes it much easier to
        configure the gamepad for games with special requirements.
      </p>
      
      <h2>Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>runs in userspace on top of libusb, no kernel recompile
          required, very easy to get started</li>
        <li>gives you what you would expect from a driver, like a
          normal joystick device and a event device</li>
        <li>allows you to handle analog-triggers as a single z-axis, as buttons or as
          seperate axis</li>
        <li>allows you to handle the dpad as buttons or as axis</li>
        <li>allows you to set the LED status of the XBox360 gamepad</li>
        <li>allows you to set the rumble motors, for use in scripts for
          new mail notification</li>
        <li>it supports the use multiple gamepads</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Missing Features</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>rumble support is limited to scripting or testing, it
          doesn't yet support Linux force feedback handling, so you
          can't use it in games</li>
        <li>you can't remap the buttons</li>
        <li>you can't change the order of axis</li>
        <li>XBox dancemat support is untested and limited</li>
        <li>XBox360 wireless gamepad support isn't tested</li>
        <li>XBox's analog face buttons can't be used via the joystick
          device, since they are converted to digital ones</li>
        <li>no mouse emulation</li>
      </ul>
